KDI: N. Korea Likely to Expand Trade with China amid Supply Shortages,"A researcher at a state-run South Korean think tank believes that North Korea will ease its pandemic induced border closure to address the shortage of industrial materials. Kim Soo-jeong at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade offered this analysis during a presentation at an academic forum on Friday. Kim said the shortage of intermediate and capital goods must have worsened in North Korea with decreased imports from China amid the pandemic and global sanctions, and argued that it would be impossible to maintain closed borders any longer. Kim projected that Pyongyang will seek to expand imports from China, especially industrial items that are not subject to sanctions, and stressed the importance of reviving North Korea-China trade. Bilateral trade that plummeted in early 2020 has been gradually recovering since the resumption of rail operation between Dandong and Sinuiju last year. Food such as rice and flour likely account for most shipments going into the North this year.                  "
China Protests Seoul's Summon of its Ambassador ,"China has raised objection with South Korea's summon of its ambassador to protest Beijing's criticism of President Yoon Suk Yeol's recent comments on Taiwan. In a regular briefing Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that China has sternly proposed talks to South Korea both in Beijing and Seoul regarding the erroneous remarks made on the Taiwan issue. China customarily uses such expression of ""sternly proposing talks"" when it files a protest on a certain matter through diplomatic channels. On Thursday, Seoul's foreign ministry summoned Chinese Ambassador Xing Haiming to strongly protest China's reaction to Yoon’s remarks in an interview with Reuters saying that he opposes any attempts to change the status quo by force in reference to the Taiwan issue. Following the interview, Beijing said it would not allow others to meddle in the Taiwan issue, calling on Seoul to adhere to the ""One China"" policy while asserting the issue is an internal matter. South Korea called such remarks ""rude"" and a ""grave lack of diplomatic etiquette.""                  "

One military official said it is expected that the plane will take about 24 hours to reach Sudan. Earlier in the day, President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered swift measures be taken to protect South Koreans in the country, including the dispatch of military aircraft.

"S. Korea, UK, Japanese Lawmakers to Seek to Provide N. Koreans with Internet Access","Lawmakers from South Korea, Britain and Japan have agreed to seek ways to directly provide internet access to North Korea’s general population. The International Parliamentarians' Coalition for Asian Human Rights said on Thursday that it reached the agreement with the British parliament's All-Parliamentary Group on North Korea, which was included in a joint statement issued at the 19th general meeting of the International Parliamentarians' Coalition for North Korean Refugees and Human Rights in London. In the statement, the legislators said that the continued denial of internet access by the regime should compel the international community to seek ways to provide access to the North's people and create a global fund for the provision of internet services in the reclusive state. The statement also called on the international community, including South Korea, Britain, the U.S. and Japan, to establish common international norms and regulations on responding to the North’s cyberattacks, and to form a consultative body to deter and prevent them. Internet in the North is restricted by Pyongyang, with a local intranet called “Kwangmyong” providing access to state-approved materials, including news sources such as the official newspaper of the ruling Workers’ Party, the Rodong Sinmun.

Terraform Labs CEO Kwon Indicted in Montenegro,"Prosecutors in Montenegro have reportedly indicted Terraform Labs co-founder Kwon Do-hyeong on passport forgery charges. According to a report in local newspaper Pobjeda on Thursday, the fugitive CEO widely known as Do Kwon and a close confidant surnamed Han have been referred to trial for allegedly forging official documents, with the prosecution also requesting that their detainment be extended. Kwon was arrested on March 23 at the airport in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, while attempting to board a flight to Dubai with a fake passport after being on the run for eleven months following massive investor losses of nearly 40 billion U.S. dollars worldwide caused by his cryptocurrency firm.

China’s FM: Those Who Play with Fire over Taiwan Will Burn to Death,"China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, has warned that those who play with fire over Taiwan are certain to burn to death. According to the Chinese foreign ministry, Qin made the remark on Friday during a forum hosted by the ministry as he stressed that Taiwan is key to China’s main interests in an apparent rebuke of President Yoon Suk Yeol’s earlier comments on the issue. The minister used the same expression that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had as he conveyed his dissatisfaction with a visit to the island by U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi last August, warning President Joe Biden about “playing with fire” in a phone call the month before her visit. Qin went on to criticize claims that China is seeking to change the status quo of the Taiwan Strait by force and is challenging the global order. Though Qin did not mention Yoon by name in his comments, they appeared to be a check on remarks by the South Korean president in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday that he is opposed to Beijing's efforts to force Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty. Qin’s comments were also perceived to be a warning to Seoul and Washington ahead of discussions on the Taiwan issue set to be included in the South Korea-U.S. summit which will be held in Washington next Wednesday.

25 Areas Susceptible to Risk of Failure to Return ‘Jeonse’ Deposit,"The risk of problems with lump-sum “jeonse” rental deposits affecting multi-unit buildings and studio apartments is prevalent in 25 areas nationwide. According to the Korea Real Estate Board on Friday, 25 regions between January and March this year posted a sales-to-rental deposit price ratio for such housing units of over 80 percent. Ratios in excess of the threshold carry a greater chance that the landlord may be unable to return the deposit to the tenant, even if the property is sold. Recent cases of organizational fraud also involved the landlord taking out a loan during construction, in which the lending institution had priority for the right to collateral security. Moreover, in the wake of a decline in housing prices, there were even cases in which the jeonse price exceeded that of the sales price, such as in the central city of Daejeon, where the ratio stood at 131-point-eight percent. A recent series of deaths by suicide of young people has been attributed to problems with such deposits, prompting the government to pursue remedies to the system.                  "
USFK Chief Calls for Bigger Training Budget to Maintain Deterrence,"The commander of U.S. Forces Korea(USFK) appealed for an increased training budget to maintain deterrence against North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile threats. In a written response to the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, USFK Commander Gen. Paul LaCamera said that although efforts are under way to resume Seoul and Washington's combined live training, the budget is insufficient. Stating that live-fire training has been limited due to spatial restrictions, LaCamera said a further budget cut would undermine USFK's capabilities to conduct such exercises on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. The commander stressed that the current funding levels should be viewed as a ""floor"" rather than a ""ceiling."" Mentioning that North Korea appears prepared to conduct its seventh nuclear test, LaCamera emphasized that a lack of external pressure renders such a test a matter not of “if” but “when.” Referring to aggressive investments by China, Russia and North Korea in information warfare technology and operational practices, LaCamera expressed concern about USFK's competitiveness in intelligence capabilities.
